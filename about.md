Imagine this scenario, you are a responsible full-time employee and working has taken
up a big portion of your everyday life. At home, you have an elderly mother you have to
look after and take good care of. You are busy from eight a.m. to five p.m. daily and
could not take good care of your dear mother. You decide to take her to the care center
for professional care.  

During work, you grew concerned about how your she is doing. You could pay a visit,
but itâ€™s hard to fit into your busy schedule without significant effort of canceling and
rescheduling.  
Nowadays, as people gets busier, they might not have time to take care of their lovedones full time or does not have the equipment for it, hence, there is a need to connect their loved-ones with them.  

Our team researched into the current applications to see if there are solutions to this
problem. Our result came back negative, although we have found a lot of applications
that provide services to a particular aspect of caring really well, but none of them
connect the family members with their loved ones that in the care center. Following
table shows different aspect of what the client wishes to do with their loved ones in the
care center and the corresponding app that accomplishes it.
